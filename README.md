TITLE
Tool with a simple graphical interface to find lost files, and duplicate files, within the filesystem.
    
DESCRIPTION
"Filegm" is the name of a tool with a simple graphical interface that aims to trace files according to 2
guidelines which are the type of format and a precise or approximate date when the file was created in memory.
The interface has 2 fields, which are the input field (left) in which the user will enter the precise date or
two date range in which the files being searched are assumed to have been stored in the machine in use, and
the output field (right) within which the eventual results of the search with their addresses in memory will
be shown according to the alphabetical order of the files. Each of the results is also a direct link to open
each file. At the bottom of the left field are two buttons: the first on the left is used to start the file
search, the second on the right starts the search for only duplicate files that may exist based on the
extensions and dates entered. One or more extensions can be entered in the extension entry field.
